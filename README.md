# :sponge: zsh-sweep

```
Usage: zsweep [--help/-h] [-C work-dir] [--auto] [--func]
                 [--script] [--src] [--dbg]

--help/-h        – this message
-C work-dir      – like -C in Git – first cd to a dir
--auto           – guess type of Zsh file
--func           – set input file type to function
--script         – set input file type to binary-script
--src            – set input file type to sourced-script
--dbg            – enable debug messages
```

## Examples

Using is calling of `zsweep` binary on the wanted files to
verify. It is good to specify type of file (command script,
sourced script and autoload function, see above), however
in practice one just passes **`--auto`** to autodetect
the type.

To sweep a `plugin.zsg` file:

```zsh
zsweep --auto zsh-sweep.plugin.zsh
```

To scan autoload functions of the project as example:

```zsh
zsweep --auto functions/*(.)
```

To scan a command script of the project with `CWD` switch
via `-C` option (`CWD` is for *current working dir*):

```zsh
# -C – cd to the given dir
zsweep -C ~/github/zsh-sweep --auto bin/zsweep
```
